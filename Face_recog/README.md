# Person identification Face Recognition 
We mainly use ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition method.
The code is based on [ArcFace-pytorch](https://github.com/TreB1eN/InsightFace_Pytorch) implementation.

This repository is not completed.
We will update new training code and add Person re-identification for undetected face.

# How to use
```
1. Make face bank
2. run face_verify.py to make facebank.pth
3. 

```
